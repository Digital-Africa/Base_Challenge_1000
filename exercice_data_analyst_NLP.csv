0,145,agriculture,"Desert Green Africa is an Agri-tech company that provides agricultural extension and technical support to small-scale farmers through remote and active management of crop production throughout Africa. We deliver value-chain solutions to our small-scale farmers by supporting them with day-to-day management, from production to market & distribution. A mobile platform designed to increase yields and improve quality of fresh produce for small-scale farmers to improve their ability to supply formal markets as well as linking with micro-financing opportunities (i.e. crowd-farming & other Fintech instruments). The app simplifies the process of developing full-scale production plans & assisting any farmer with daily operations of the farm from soil prep.to harvest. It will also improve traceability for food regulation to enable for export (GAP). Co-founded in 2015, formally registered in 2016, by 3 young entrepreneurs from different walks of life with 3 things in common: a rural upbringing, a passion for Agri-tech & a near-impossible vision for a self-sustaining connected Africa. We Collaborated in the SAB Ltd. Nelson Mandela Day's corporate Social Responsibility program to equip rural dwellers in Bushbuckridge Mpumalanga to start micro-farms using unutilized backyard plots in 2017. First place winner of the 2018 South African Global Student Entrepreneurship Awards (GSEA-SA) competition. Represented South Africa at the GSEA finals in Canada. Desert Green Africa finished in the top 6 award-winning finalists out of 56 Global candidates. Honoured with the Sergey Vhykodtsev award for being a resilient business that used its obstacles to grow. In 2018, we set out to development relationships with the farmers whom we see fit eligible to be part of our initial network of farmers for our pilot period planned from June 2020 to June 2021. The network of farms is made of 23 farms in total ranging from 1.5 to 640 ha in size and aggregates to a total of 737 ha of cultivable land. The farms are located in Meyerton (60-70 km from Johannesburg CBD), Witbank & Cho Cho Cho (Bushbuckridge Mpumalanga). In total, out of the 23 farms we are currently actively supporting 4. The rest of them we advise on a general basis but they still remain with the autonomy to follow their own planting programs. At this point, 19 of the farms have very limited access to our support due to lack of guaranteed market resulting in lack of financial resources required to effectively support the farmers.Currently the service that is readily available to our network of farmers and the potential market at large, is our manual hands-on Agronomic support services with day to day operations as well as partnership developments with access to formal markets and potential production  finance partners. This is due to the fact that developing the Mobile App requires financial resources to develop a working prototype that we can pilot between June 2020 & June 2021 before going to market with the product thereafter. Agriculture is a long-term game, it will take atleast 1 full season with about 4 planting cycles to prove positive and reliable results with our Mobile App concept.Currently in the small-scale farming market in South Africa. We are currently based in one region with our active farmers based around Johannesburg South & East. There's also other farmer networks we have access to in Mpumalanga that we havent yet started servicing due to limited resources.Johannesburg East & South (Midvaal, Meyerton & Eastrand)- Secure uptake agreements for our farmers with Pick n Pay / Boxer & Spar
- Complete development of a working prototype by June 2020
- Complete pilot phase of atleast 10 farms by June 2021

1,171,agriculture,"1. Makeni Harvest is a small-scale urban farm that produces and supplies various farm foods. We contribute to sustainable farming practices by using recycled organic matter to produce our largest crop mushroom. In addition, after harvesting the mushroom, we make use of the spent compost as a nutrient rich compost for conditioning and organically fertilizing our soil to produce all our other farm vegetables.
2.Fermented Compost
We produce good quality compost for mushroom growing. Our minimum order quantity is 1tonne. Because we use the natural composting method, out compost cycle takes about 21-28 days to mature. 
The compost has the perfect carbon-nitrogen (C:N) ratio to support Agaricus Bisporus white button mushroom growing
3. White Button Mushroom 
As Makeni Harvest, we are proud to be one of the few Zambian farms producing button mushroom locally whilst ensuring sustainable farming methods
4. Seasonal Mushroom
Most of the seasonal mushroom that we source is between the period of late October and late February. Owing to the fact that Zambia has a large Miombo woodland distribution, there is a wide variety of mushroom delicacies.
5.Farm Vegetables
We supply a range of vegetables such as Eggplants, Peppers, Tomatoes, Butternut, Pumpkin leaves, Carrots, Okra, Baby Marrow and many more.
6. Supply of Spawn
We are the only company that re-sells Sylvan spawn.
7. Hands On Mushroom Farming Training
There is a big gap between the demand and production of mushroom. As a company, we have positioned ourselves to respond to this gap by providing a hands on training for farmers wishing to venture into mushroom farming, in order to increase the production of mushrooms in Zambia
8. Locally Sourced
All our farm produce is produced and sourced locally. We work closely with other small-scale farmers like ourselves to meet your food needs.Zambians are becoming  health conscious and  making healthy food choices. Mushroom being a healthy protein source  has led to high demand and consumption. Currently 95% of the mushroom in Zambian supermarkets are sourced from South Africa. Makeni Harvest recognized this gap but also wanted to pursue a more sustainable farming method that reduced the production of farming waste. In wanting to meet these two objectives we researched how best to use organic waste to the maximum potential. We did so by sourcing organic waste from nearby stable which we use to grow our crop and the waste from our crop is used to fertilize our farm produce.Food industry and supermarketsThe current geographical area of activity is Lusaka, Zambia in Sub-Saharan AfricaOur medium term growth objectives are to increase our production capacity efficiently to meet 40% of the Zambian mushroom demand and our longer-term objective is to establish a larger mushroom association, which will increase the number of mushroom farmers to increase the overall national mushroom production. We see this association exporting mushroom inputs and produce to neighboring countries, this increased demand will in turn improve the spawn production process in Zambia.As the demand for food increases, many farmers are going commercial in order to meet the demand for more food. They in turn are generating large quantities of farm waste as their production capacity increases. Some of these expansions are at the expense of conservation farming practices. Our model is to use one type of farm waste for three additional uses, these being compost making, a growing medium for our crop and spent compost as an organic fertilizer.The best way to make this model duplicable at a lower cost is by reducing on the transport costs and doing the composting method at the source of manure. Another way is using a cheaper source of manure such as chicken manure which is cheaper and easier to source than horse manure.From an environmental stand point our produce reduces the amount of waste being discarded and at the same time responds to food security issues by producing a crop that increases the food variety of the Country. On the social point of view, our company has employed  an equal distribution of men and women casual workers promoting gender equality and supporting smaller families take their children to school."
2,189,agriculture,"we design and manufacture hydroponic farming technology, which is a vertical shelf structure that grows shallow root agricultural products using only water and added nutrients, without the need for planting in soil.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
These are also fully/partially automated vegetable production systems with controlled environments, and are immune to natural weather variations. They require water, light, temperature, humidity, and aeration are fully controlled by sensors. 

HOW TO USE PRODUCT
Choose a high-quality vegetable seed. Place a vegetable seed into a growing medium such as a pellet. Put the seeds in a dish of water for two weeks in a dark condition. In that time, the seeds should sprout into little seedlings. Keeping the cubes in a dark condition is essential for curbing algae growth. Germination will take about 7-14 days. Once the sprout appears, put the cubes into a pot and transplant to the Vegiegro
Wait 4 to 5 weeks to harvest the vegetable. Make sure you place your plants near the sun, but not in direct all-day sun and preferably somewhere that gets morning sun only. Direct all-day sunlight is not suitable for vegetable and leafy greens as too much heat will cause the plant to feel stressed. This will result in it starting to bolt (flowering) which will make the leaves taste bitter and change the texture of your produce.

A Project to Create 100,000 High-Economic Impact Jobs for Rural and Urban Youth by 2025
“BY YOUTH FOR YOUTH”Our product takes up to 400% less land to grow the same amount of crops: Leaving more land for other uses such as wildlife reserves and also saving trees, which would otherwise be cleared for agricultural purposes. You can grow anywhere. Your environment is sterile, which means no pesticides.
The system and the farm service that we are providing will help farmers as well as end-users to farm and buy freshly produced and served vegetables, for urban farming it’s the ideal way to reduce carbon footprint as there is no need to bring the produce from far farm areas.Our hydroponic systems are customized to the users’ needs, and tailored for different types of products, as well as modular and easy to use. and we always experiment to utilize our resources as well as always thrives to increase efficiency.With Africa’s population nearing 450M today and projected to reach 1.6B in 2030, the demand for more food is rising steeply; it’s clear that farming needs to become more productive to outrun the population rate of increase.
Benefit: One way of meeting future food needs is hydroponics and as we have started partnering with different stockholders from different African countries, working with various development sector partners, public and Gov. Intuitions that have vested interest in empowering SHFs, youth, women, and refugees. This model has proved to extend our reach faster and our impact deep scale up our sales.

3,252,agriculture,"We are a team of soil scientists, entrepreneurs, software developers, hardware engineers and farmers who harbours and shares a burning passion to significantly contribute to the improvement of the local food supply and overall development of West Africa. We are bringing the future of Agriculture to Africa, becoming one of the frontiers of precision farming. We are leveraging technology to set the pace for data and market-demand driven farming across communities in Africa.
Our mandate is to empower rural farmers, contribute to food security in Nigeria and provide a healthy means of engaging people with Agriculture from a profit driven perspective. We are highly committed, collaborative and energetic and we believe that with a little support, Farmpadi Agritech Innovations (FAI) will make farming more productive, more convenient and more attractive.
We started operations since 2018 and has empowered over 300 farmers across the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. In the near future we expect to grow and further impact more farmers across Nigeria and other African countries.We offer farmers the Farmpadi Electronic Sensor (FEC) which is an integrated hardware, software and SMS system for real time monitoring of the soil nutrient level, moisture, temperature, as well as provision of fertilization and irrigation decision support system. The device is an intelligent
electronics sensor which when inserted in a farm soil collects pertinent data like humidity, temperature, pH, moisture, nutrients etc and wirelessly transmits the data to a cloud server where advanced computational models help to make sense of what is happening on the farm. The sensed farm data is further processed, analyzed and sent to the farmer via SMS or voice calls in local languages. The device is powered with solar with a battery capacity that can last for days and connectivity is made possible via WIFI and GSM with a provision for manual data collection with micro SD card.
By sourcing and translating these farm data to farmers, Farmpadi eliminates guess farming . Hence, farmers will produce more at a lesser input; food will become cheaper and more readily available for the local market and in the long-run will contribute to improved household food security and improved livelihood for the local farmers.

How it works
1. Pin the Farmpadi Smart device into the ground.
2. Connect the device to your phone by
a. scanning the barcode through the farmpadi mobile app.
b. Copy the Farmpadi Smart device serial number and text it alongside your phone number and preferred language to a phone number inscribed on the device.
3. The farmer instantly receive a ‘Successful Registration’ SMS and a call from an assigned Farmpadi officer.
4. The device first scans the farm and tests for soil nutrient and PH level. This provides farmers knowledge on the crop-blended fertilizer to boost their yield and the quantity to apply.
5. Farmpadi Smart device further senses the soil moisture and helps the farmer control water usage for optimal plant growth. It reports the weather condition and determines to a farmer the optimal time to plant and harvest. Through the Farmpadi ultrasonic transducer, it is able to control pest invasion without the use of traps or pesticides.

Note:
<U+25CF> These signals are sent through SMS or as notifications on the Farmpadi mobile app.
<U+25CF> Farmers are assigned a Farmpadi project officer (FAPO) who also receives the farm data, analyzes and interprets the data, engages, educates and inform the farmer on the farm condition and best farming practices in the farmer’s local dialect.Our market targets are farmers and farming communities.Our customers are proactive farmers who have basic or advanced mobile phones and Agric investors/stakeholders who wants to stay updated on their farm conditions.We have started with the Niger Delta region of Nigeria and expect to grow from here and cover other parts of Nigeria and Africa at large. As reported by Ike and Ekanem,2016, the mean potential annual yields of food crops in the Niger Delta region is 52.95 metric tonnes per hectare. This level of output was achieved under traditional and non-mechanized methods of production and mostly unscientific application of inputs. Scholars suggest the region can produce significant amount of what Nigeria consumes under good and modern practices and management.
Hence Farmpadi, through its tech-oriented approach to farming targets to improve the regions' annual food crop yield by 25% to a minimum of 66.25 metric tonnes per hectare.We expect a horizontal growth of 50,000 users across farming communities and regions in Africa. We also anticipate to develop more partnerships and increase our presence in the industry and a vertical growth that will enable us extend our reach to livestock and aquaculture farms.
Farmpadi Agritech Innovations targets to reach 2000 farms in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria within the next 2 years and consequently increase the region's output and annual food crop yield by 25% which is a minimum of 66.25 metric tonnes per hectare. 
By the next five years we hope to have designed, developed and mass produced the FARMPADI AQUA, a similar Farmpadi electronic sensor for affordable monitoring and automation of aquaculture farms in the Niger Delta. The device will help farmers remotely monitor water quality and feed intake
patterns. Also, we will use Farmpadi artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to precisely dispense the feed based on demand. This will help farmers reduce risk and improve productivity by enabling the optimal use of feed and energy, making aquaculture farming in Africa more sustainableWe believe that ideas and innovations rule the world. In view of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals on Zero Hunger, Farmpadi provides farmers adequate knowledge and information on what to farm, when to when and how to farm by offering an internet of thing (IoT) device for real time monitoring of the soil moisture, temperature, as well as provision of fertilization and irrigation decision support system. An innovative solution that enable farmers produce more agricultural output with a less input. Farmpadi also increases farmers access to market and reduces post harvest loss by providing the farmers actionable market demand data to enable them grow what processors want and not what they are accustomed to.Most smallholder farmers in Africa have a low income level and could not afford computers or advanced mobile phones; hence the Farmpadi Electronic sensor was designed to provide maximum value and utility to the farmers. This  birthed the integration of an SMS system that allows these underserved farmed receive signals and notifications from their Farmpadi sensor to their mobile phones.Farmpadi will relatively increase farm output, local food productions and farm incomes in Nigeria and other African countries. Hence, food will become cheaper and more readily available for the local market and possible exports (to France or any other country) which in the long-run will contribute to improved household food security and improved livelihood in Africa."

We are  into different areas of Agribusiness and Value Chain addition, few of which are: Catfish fingerlings/ Juveniles production, table fish and brood stocks, livestock, & Snailry productions. We are also, into commercial plantain macro propagation of suckers, and Moringa seedlings/ tree Plantation, Stevia seedlings production, and farm setup. We are into the setting up of locally made Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS) for fingerlings, juveniles and table sized fish Production. We have expertise in Earthen and Concrete Ponds design and Construction, Storm Water sedimentation and general Aquaculture water treatment. Our value chain addition work includes the processing and packaging of culturable fish, Moringa into oil, soap, body cream, tea, capsule, powder supplements, liquid extracts, etc. We built the 1,000,000 and 500,000 litre storm water sedimentation system for Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti  the 500,000 fingerlings production hatchery and 500 tonnes phase two fish farm. In addition, we designed, built and manage the Moringa Processing Factory for ABUAD which is the largest in West Africa presently.( Dr Akinwunmi Adesina visited us in 2015, Chief Audu Ogbeh came in July 2017). 
In training, we have trained over 12,000 individuals in different areas of Agribusiness value chain and 
processing, we take and train industrial trainees students/ NYSC members from different Universities and higher institutions in Nigeria.  
In the last decade, we have been able to help thousands of Nigerian farmers and organizations in starting up and sustaining their agribusiness ventures.  
Furthermore, Bic Farms Concepts is Nigeria’s number1 hydroponics/ Aquaponics technology and vertical farming proponent. In the last two years, we have trained about 20,000 people through our monthly Seminars  on this technology, especially those into high value vegetables production, greenhouse tomatoes and fodder production for cattle, goats, pigs and other livestock rearing. We are helping cattle farmers  to set up fodder systems so as not to depend on grazing, thereby solving herdsmen challenge gradually. 
Boldly, we are Nigeria’s first local Greenhouse/ hydroponics technology based company. We train and help clients to start a business using soilles farming Model. This has given birth to more exotic vegetables growers in Nigeria. Presently with our clients, we grow vegetables like cauliflowers, Lettuce, Rocket leaves(arugular), Herbs, Tomatoes, black tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, Red cabbage.  
We build and setup Hydroponics Greenhouses of different sizes. In addition to this, we help clients solve their vegetables growing problem, and so solving food production issues with our clients. Bic farms Farms Concepts is at 1-2, Sarumi close, Asero-Estate,  Abeokuta. The company is led by its founder, Adebowale Onafowora.

The product is a complete soilless greenhouse, which has the greenhouse, substrates, fertigation systems, seeds and nutrients for one cycle of productionYoung Adults between the ages of 35 and 60. They have a steady job with the government, private firms and some are Entrepreneurs. Majorly, they additional income with their current pay, and most of them are interested in Entrepreneurship. They hope to focus on their food production business oneday when it would have started paying their salaries.Major Cities in Nigeria. Like Lagos, Abuja, porthacourt Ogun- State, Oyo, Enugu, Kano, Kaduna, and cross-river state. Mostly the Urban areas in Nigeria,  especially the southern part of Nigeria where large scale food production is a little difficult.My 2 years goal is to get our Hydroponics greenhouses to about 1,000 individuals, growing about 10,000 tons of Vegetables annually,  and in 5 years to have about 5,000 people cultivating about 120 hectares of Hydroponics Greenhouse cluster farms. The entire cluster will be producing about 50,000 tons of vegetables annually.1- I'm growing vegetables like tomatoes, bell peppers, habanero, and cucumbers in a soilless greenhouse environment, using ricehusk( waste from rice processing) and  Responsive Drip irrigation system,  which is an artificial intelligence based drip system that doesn't require electricity to funtion. 
ideally, you can't grow well using pure ricehusk as substrates becuse it has a very low water holding capacity. Now, with the RDI, we are able to use the substrates to grow efficiently. The RDI is a drip irrigation tube that doesn't have an emitting point, but millions or micro pores that only responds to plant root exudates. When plant needs water or nutrients, the root releases some chemicals into the substrates, which is what the drip system responds to.
Furthermore, with Hydroponics technology, the young folks are now embracing farming because it makes it more interesting and attractive for them.
Lastly, I'm using Hydroponics technology to grow fodders for livestocks. This makes it easier to ranch cows, and stop the clashes between heardsmen and farmers.The firat thing we need to know is, using the Hydroponics technology system,  we get to achieve the following over normal conventional way of growing crops:
1- Save 80% on irrigation water 
2- Saves 90% on arable land usae, as it only requires about 10% or less when we take it vertical. 
3- Eliminates/ reduces the usage of pesticides  and other agro chemicals 
4- Crops like fodder for animals feed only requires 7- 9 days, as against 90 days on the soil. so it saves lot or time and resources. 
5- Because I've localised some of the technology required, the usage of affordable and a available materials is now possible.1- It saves 80%-90% on water usage as against conventional farming
2- It saves 80-90% on land requirements 
3- No need for crop rotation as we can grow same over and over again
4 We can extend the growing seasons
5- We can grow indoor and so convert all our empty warehouses, and abandoned spaces usin grow lights.
6- We can reduce greenhouse gas drastically because we don't need to cut down trees, and also we can now grow the food closer to the market.
7- We can save on post harvest loss because we can grow at a food proximity to the market
8- We can save on energy requirements 
9-We can quadruple our yield, yet reduce our input."
5,418,agriculture,"Green WATECH offers a new low cost, efficient and practical solution of sanitation called Multi Soil Layering Technology “Patent: MA 37803 A1, Cl. international: B01D 25/02; C02F 3/02; C02F 1/00, 2018”. This technology consists on water filtration using natural, available and low cost materials such as soil, gravel, sawdust and iron metal. Compared to the existing solutions, Green WATECH technology is economically feasible, environmentally sustainable and socially acceptable.
Green WATECH works on reducing the effects of wastewater reject (Water diseases), protecting water resources (groundwater and surface water), increasing awareness on the preservation of the environment and promoting education of children in rural schools by providing a good sanitation service. Green WATECH offers also job opportunities for local population by participation in engineering work during the conception of wastewater treatment plant and by the development of agriculture sector.Our start up GREEN WATECH offers a new low cost, efficient and practical solution of rural sanitation called ‘Multi-Soil-Layering’ System (Patent: MA 37803 A1, 2017). Domestic wastewater is collected from households in rural areas and treated by our technology that produce high quality of treated water that can be safely reused in irrigation.
MSL technology is an innovative wastewater treatment technology based on water filtration using low cost and available materials in rural areas.
Removal of pollutants from wastewater through MSL technology is a complicated process involving various chemical, physical and biological processes. GREEN WATECH plays an important role in raising the awareness of the rural population about the preservation of the environment and water resources.The main target in the public sector are the rural communities, villages (only in Morocco, 15 Million people living in 32000 rural villages), decentralized institute (12 000 rural schools), where the absence of adequate sanitation has a serious impact on health and social development, especially for children. 
We also target the private sector through Guest houses, and hotels in rural areas for smaller projects and therefore less profitable, but with terms of payment much more favourable.Our plan for the next 24 months is to scale to 4 other regions of Morocco ( RSK region & north region), We plan to build 10 new wastewater treatment plant in rural villages in 2 years, as well as 8  WWTP for ""individuals"", and increase the number of technical studies to 10 studies in 2020.
We plan to increase the number of projects in the next 2 years thanks to this solicitation and the advertising generated by our first achievements.
Our challenge is to impact 1 Million people by 2025.
Africa is the most affected country by the problems related to sanitation. Actually, we have several demands from African countries (Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Senegal, etc). Our strategy to scale for the 2 first years is to make more visibility in Moroccan Market which is a big Market as well, from the third year, we will target the African and the global market.Our start up GREEN WATECH offers a new low cost, efficient and practical solution of rural sanitation called ‘Multi-Soil-Layering’ System (Patent: MA 37803 A1, 2017). GREEN WATECH plays an important role in raising the awareness of the rural population about the preservation of the environment and water resources. Our MSL technology is an innovative technology based on water filtration using low cost and available materials like soil and gravel. Compared to others natural wastewater treatment technologies (lagoons, wetlands and sand filters), MSL system is characterized by several advantages:
- The investment and operational costs of MSL method are very low,
- Small area demand resulting from the their high hydraulic capacity,
- Simple maintenance; no special competence was needed to operate the MSL system,
- Minimum sludge production,
- No frequent clogging,
- The application of high organic and hydraulic loading rate,
- No energy requirement for operation,
- The effectiveness of MSL technology to treat wastewater is climate, season and temperature fluctuations independent,
- Treated wastewater can be reused in agricultural practice,
- The effective life is estimated to be longer than 20 years.The main technological solutions existing in the rural sanitation market (lagooning, reed plant filter and sand filters) suffer from technical difficulties such as risk of odors and insects, occupied a large surface, long residence time, and clogging risks. In addition to the technical difficulties of the competing solutions, their prices remain exorbitant, and exceed the capacities of the communes,
In addition to the cost that is at least 3 times cheaper, using Green WATECH, we mortgage less surface and therefore less land, In addition to these advantages, other advantages are worth mentioning
Long process life: over 20 years Efficiency independent of seasonal fluctuations, no energy input no loss of water treated by evaporation Easy maintenance , no filter cloggingAfrica is the most affected country by the problems related to sanitation. Actually, we have several demands from African countries (Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Senegal, etc).

7,488,agriculture,"Nakekela is very passionate about conserving the environment and believes that community outreach through environmental education bare positive results in bringing awareness and a change in attitude. Ignorance by the community leads to a lack of understanding and appreciating the importance of proper environmental management. Nakelela believes that this can be remedied by the sustained provision of environmental education to the community. We believe that continuous education is crucial in improving the quality of the community and the sustainability of the earth’s finite resources for the future generations.
South Africans has enshrined Constitutional right to an environment that is conducive to the good health, general well-being of all people and one that is protected for the benefit of the present and future generations. The protection of our natural resources ensures the ongoing provision of ecosystem services such as the production of clean water through good catchment management, prevention of soil erosion and the creation of an environment conducive for clean air and that can only be addressed through environmental education and awareness of how those can be sustained. Our actions today have a bearing on the quality of life that future generations will inherit.
As more and more people accept that in the long-term community well-being can be achieved only within the context of a healthy earth community through environmental education, the challenge for us, and the next few generations, is to find novel and practical ways of drawing inspiration from the rich diversity of human experience as well as environmental awareness in order to  establish effective means of changing human behaviour to ensure that they contribute to the flourishing of the whole earth community instead of destroying it.
Active involvement of communities in managing their environment must be a daily activity. Equality, access, accountability, transparency, responsibility and sustainable living must be our watchword.Precision Agriculture applied with Organic Crop Protection
My Agricultural experience (five years in the co-operative, academic knowledge in botany) led me to a sustainable organic crop protection concept based on the following five building blocks.
First, it entails plant nutrition. In this concept, organic compost fertilizer and use of earthworms, and plasticulture are combined. Organic compost fertiliser improves soil structure, nutrition in soil, water retention partially due to earthworm activity as they aerate soil. This allows for deeper penetration of water and roots, resulting in healthier plants. Healthy plants are more resistant to diseases as they are not stressed. To improve the soil moisture regime, the use of plasticulture mulching is incorporated, thereby retaining soil moisture, protecting germination of seedlings and prevention of weeds.
Second, it entails organic crop protection for the control of insects that introduce and spread bacterial, fungal and viral diseases. Identification of prevalent diseases and pests for a specific crop, season and location is the basis for selecting appropriate control plants. Planting certain plants and herbs like springs onions, marigold, mint, basil, lavender and rosemary in alternate rows to your crops, cut down insects and bugs damage. Introduction of ladybugs (Coccinellidae septempunctata) that feed off aphids and to other plants eating pests. A single lady beetle can gobble more than 5000 aphids and I consider this a better idea that prevents chemical use. Lady beetles are harmless to plants and humans.
Third, weed control is based on covering the soil with 300 micron plastic that is coloured black on side (facing down) and white on the side facing up. It deprives weeds of light whilst the white reflects light for the crops above as such a multiplier for sunlight and enhanced photosynthesis. Weed control, esp. for bacterial and algal diseases is done through the treating of water with an organic spore kill.
Fourth, the use of a green shade cloth structure for open field vegetables assists in keeping the plants moisture, protect plants from excessive sunrays and storm. Often wind damage to plants is mistaken as thrips and is treated chemically. Wind damage is prevented with green shade cloth wind breaks.
Last, introducing bee keeping within the green shade cloth assist in rapid plant pollination, longer flowering of plants, increase crop yield and harvesting period (longer plant life span). With rapid plant pollination yields are higher without the need for more irrigation.
I also use drip irrigation system and storing water to feed plants through gravitational flow. Drip irrigation prevent leaves diseases caused by long term direct contact of plant leaves and water like pustules, blights, spots and specks as it waters directly to the roots of the plant.
Organic crop protection takes time and work. It is location specific based on climatic conditions, incidence of pests and diseases and avaI have currently identified some of the potential clients within the Agricultural Sector. Especially farmers associations with farmers that specializes in macadamia nuts, avocado and citrus because these commodities are very sensitive and requires a highly efficient, reliable and intelligent tool. All projects that are funded by the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform, Department of Agriculture, Forest and Fisheries, District and Local Municipalities. In most cases there is less extension support offered to beneficiaries, as a results the success percentage for small scale farmers, emerging farmers and co-operatives is very low in agricultural sector. When beneficiaries fail, government losses lot of money and that negatively impact on tax payers.Organic crop protection takes time, and can be location specific based on climatic conditions, incidence of pests and diseases and available type of composting material, as such requires lot of steps to be followed to ensure soil is being prepared proper before planting and it is labour intensive but it is worth exploring. The mandate for this proposed idea is to tackle the following key issues facing the country and the continent, food security, unemployment, poverty alleviation and transfer of permaculture skills. 

Organic Crop Protection idea will have positive social impact through addressing problems such as unemployment, poverty, lack of knowledge and less development skills. I have gone through trial and error period and learnt my lessons with that experience I am confident to make this opportunity a success story. I discovered that organic crops protection display best results in yield and market demand.
It is always essential to acquire knowledge and pass it on to benefit othT o be a leading organization in Organic Farming , to obtaining Organic Farming Certificate and to conduct organic trainings.I looked at the growing populations in cities and peri-urban areas with limited space for food production and cities are being seen beyond residential infrastructure, and more multi-purpose, which should include agriculture, e.g. the city of Johannesburg is the largest urban forest in the world. Cities generally produce the most waste, which also includes a significant component of organic waste, which eventually pollutes waterways, e.g. higher concentration of nitrates and sulphates in cities due to concentration of consumption.
 The crop production chemicals and fertilisers are generally produced in concentrations around the world and have high carbon footprints, with fertilisers being primarily oil-derived and use a lot of energy to produce. The market for organic produce is growing and sells at a premium, small scale peri-urban farmers could be taught production principles and sell to periodic markets in the cities; e.g. vegetable clubs to which fresh in-season organic vegetables are delivered on specific days.The concept is low cost - recycling based organic crop production in cities and peri-urban areas, where principles of organic crop nutrition and organic crop protection are used in a holistic production process. The concept includes the development of a demonstration plot, and exploration of the potential to sell support services and products to aspiring urban and peri-urban farmers.

8,491,agriculture,"Mobo Greeners (Pty) Ltd, established in 2015, offer skills training on
Permaculture (organic farming) and Hydroponics with the main focus being
Urban Agriculture. The business was started in order to meet the growing needs
of a community that are concerned about what they eat and feed their children.
This is a community that is tired of ‘fresh’ tomatoes bought at the local grocery
store. When more than likely the “fresh” tomatoes were picked while still unripe,
shipped 3,000 km over several days/weeks, and then artificially ""ripened"" using
ethylene gas, thus robbing it of practically all of its nutritional value.
The business was started by Mr Bongane Godfrey Nkwanyana who owns 100%
of it. Bongane studied Hydrophonics and Permaculture at South West Gauteng
College in 2010 and Business Management at Unisa in 2012. He worked as an
Agricultural Consultant at a Horticultural shop in Randburg in 2013. His duties
were to visit commercial and small scale farmers to marketing the services and
products of the shop and to recommend solutions to problems faced such as
pests, soil conditions, etc. When the shop closed two years later due to financial
constraints, Bongane began to volunteer working in different farms to expand his
knowledge and to creating a client data base. After 4 months of volunteering and
helping urban farmers in the field of farming he saw an opportunity in that all the
farms he was helping, lacked knowledge and that is where the idea of training
came about. Bongane initially approached schools, Skill Development Centers
and friends in the community with the concept. These connections marked the
beginning of business for the start-up Agricultural Skills Programmed and as
word of mouth spread, Mobo Greeners Pty (Ltd) attracted other Skill Centers and
Schools. Partnership with Region D Farmers Forum, and UJ University (Izindaba
Zokudla) where we draw our experience. Thus we have sufficient resources to carry
out various projects.
The purpose of this business plan is to provide a blueprint for short term and
long term goals. The business plan will be utilized as a tool to gauge how well
the business is doing in the future compared to initial goals and keep them
attainable. The business plan is also a tool for lenders, to explain the need for
funding, the source and utilization of funds, and debt management.

production and social system are supported. Farmers benefit from the market and price
stability. This is achieved when communities support their farmers through community
shared agriculture programs, farmers markets, and local distribution networks.
By localizing their production, urban farms cut down on the significant amount of fossil fuel
consumption necessary to transport, package, and selling of their produce. ... Urban
agriculture helps consumers reduce their “foodprint” by providing them the opportunity to
purchase food that was grown within their community.
<U+F0B7> Climate. Climatic factors include:
<U+F0B7> Soil. Soil type will influence crop cultivation because different crops prefer different
soil.
<U+F0B7> Slope. The angle of slope will affect the type, depth and moisture content of soil.
<U+F0B7> Land tenure.
<U+F0B7> Market.
<U+F0B7> Transport.

And one of its important goals is to become a city of green transport.The growth objective is to provide an e-transportation that offers a cutting edge, low carbon and affordable means of movement for Rwandans and then capitalizing on our successes and experience as a springboard for our transition to other African countries through east Africa. This is done while creating employment for the populace and promoting sustainable environment. 
Gura intends to inspire a culture of safety, helping Rwanda to achieve green growth and a sustainable environment while providing each customer with a satisfying experience.  In 5 years, our goal is the ultimate migration of transportation using innovative technology from fossil fuel-based energy to an E-mobility option. Safi brings the benefits of the vibrant and unique technological change taking over the industry across the world.
 Our long-term business interest in Rwanda is to make the country our hub in which will serve as a bedrock for exporting our green e-mobility products and services to the rest of the East African Community (EAC).The E-scooter is powered with rechargeable lithium battery to get you around the city using Smart E-Mobility. The Gura Electric bike is equipped with a smart lock and smart motor allowing you to cruise around the city with ease and speed; and the Gura Gear Assist Smart Bike can be docked  with a smart lock system equipped with 3 speeds, perfect for day-to-day mobility.We believe that having successfully piloted Gura here in Rwanda, the scale-up of the project for us will be an added advantage in terms of identified gaps and  experience. Therefore, replicating the project results in a different environment having considered other peculiarities and complexities of the new geographical location could be done at lower cost compared with the pilot experience.The growing population and increasing urbanization will result in an increase in urban area in Rwanda. This will force people to travel greater distances than necessary, with motorized transport resulting in GHG emissions and air pollution. Designing high density cities with corridors for pedestrians and cyclists and green public spaces, and provision of an environmentally friendly mobility system like Gura with no carbon emission, would reduce the need for carbon laden energy intensive transport, improve quality of life and reduce the risk of flooding. Not only will this reduce GHG emissions and oil dependency, but also reduce the burden of transport costs to citizens. Gura has a model that conforms to the direction of future sustainable mobility business in Rwanda. France and a number of African countries like Rwanda have already started making desirable progress towards eliminating most fossil fuel vehicles and Gura is right in time."

5,68,mobilite,"SMART CARD est une startup malienne évoluant dans le domaine de la sécurité des engins (spécialement les motos qui est le principal moyen de déplacement dans les pays d’Afrique de l’ouest) en se basant sur un procède innovant et unique qui utilisant un mini traceur smart GPS afin de prémunir les utilisateurs des récurrents cas de vol. 
Le système consiste à prendre de contrôle de l’engin même à distance (localisation avec précision, coupure du moteur à distance, etc.). L’innovation vient du concept de la carte à puce qui est une offre unique dans ce domaine. Le partenariat avec l’usine TOPTEN TRACKER GPS, leader sur le marché des traceurs GPS a permis de mettre en place un traceur GPS miniature (smart card) conçu spécialement pour les motos.
Elle a actuellement dépassé les phases de prototypage et de test, déclenchant ainsi les étapes liées à l’obtention d’un brevet pour la propriété intellectuelle ainsi qu’une licence de production et de commercialisation d’où l’industrialisation du processus de fabrication.SMART CARD est une innovation technologique unique dans le domaine de la sécurité des engins (Moto) contre le vol, conçu pour renforcer la sécurité. 
À l’origine nous avons commencé à utiliser des cartes SD mémoire sur lesquelles des circuits imprimés ont été implantés afin de disposer d’un code spécifique. À la suite des travaux de recherche et développement ainsi que la prise en compte des feedbacks de nos clients, nous avons puis améliore le système en concevant un traceur GPS miniaturisé adapté aux motos utilisant la dernière technologie de localisation GSM/GPRS.
Installé sur l’engin et muni d’une carte SIM le traceur permet de localiser avec précision l’emplacement de l’engin avec une vue satellitaire sur la plateforme. Celui-ci est étanche et résistant à la chaleur car conçu en tenant compte des contraintes climatiques du pays. En outre il est facilement dissimulable au vu de sa petite taille et présente une grande autonomie compte tenu de sa batterie de réserve incorporée. 
Le produit a été également développé en partenariat avec l’usine TOPTEN GPS l’un des leaders mondiaux dans ce domaine.
Ainsi, le traceur GPS présente les fonctions suivantes :
-	Track sur SMS, Web ou APP ;
-	GPS tracker + fonctions d'alarme de l’engin, armer / désarmer par SMS / web/ téléphone ;
-	Vérifier l'adresse physique réelle de l’engin (comme la ville et le nom de la rue.
-	Couper le moteur à distance ;
-	Produit imperméable à l'eau avec une taille minuscule ;
-	Voltage : 6V-45VDC, adapté pour la moto, la voiture ou la plupart des gros camions ;
-	Équiper d’une batterie interne avec une grande autonomie ;
-	Etc.
Il y a lieu également de préciser que le système sera brouillé au moment de l’installation du dispositif pour empêcher les voleurs de comprendre son fonctionnement et surtout d’avertir le client via une alerte sms en cas de tentative de vol ou de sabotage du système.Les motos étant les principaux moyens de transport dans les pays en voie de développement surtout en Afrique, elles représentent environ de 68% des moyens de déplacement dans ces pays. Selon l’Institut National de la Statistique (INSTAT), le Mali compte en 2018 environ un million de motos dont 80% se trouvant dans la capitale. De même chaque année plus de 50 000  motos sont volées. En plus ce problème ne se limite pas seulement qu’au Mali mais d’autres pays de la sous-région sont confronté à la même situation tels que : Le Burkina Faso, Le Niger, Le Cameroun, La Guinée, etc…   
Nous avons également constaté à la suite de nos enquêtes l’absence d’un système efficace, innovant et adapté à la sécurité des motos, en dehors de l’utilisation de simples cadenas pour verrouiller les roues, laissant ainsi au voleur muni d’une clé passe partout la possibilité d’ouvrir le cadenas. 
Notre segment client sera constitué :
 	Des propriétaires des motos ;
 	Des sociétés de livraison qui peuvent équiper leurs motos avec notre Smart Card et traceur GPS pour assurer la traçabilité de la livraison ;
 	Des vendeurs de motos qui peuvent équiper leurs motos afin d’avoir un bon argument de vente.

6,73,mobilite,"Technovera is a social impact organisation that is focused on technology inclusion with the aim of improving the last mile for chronic medication access in Africa.  We’ve developed Pelebox, a smart locker system that enables patients to collect their repeat chronic medication in under 22 seconds instead of waiting hours on queues at public clinics. Our Mission is to Develop, Promote and Scale Inclusive Technologies Solving Challenges of Access to Healthcare in African. Technovera designs, manufactures, installs and maintains smart lockers at the client’s facilities and other partner locations based on need.South Africa has world's biggest antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme for patients living with HIV and AIDS, with an estimated 7.2 million people living with HIV (PLHIV), and a projected increase to 7.5 million PLHIV by 2020. There's been a steady increase in the number of patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs), requiring chronic therapy. A patient's experience tends to be one of long waiting times, typically above 3.5 hours. This poses potential adherence barriers which may lead to poor health outcomes and places a strain on the patients in terms of transport costs and loss of income.

We’ve developed Pelebox, a smart locker system that enables patients to collect their repeat chronic medication in under a minute instead of waiting hours on queues at public clinics. It’s an internet-enabled smart locker leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) to enable unassisted patient collections.

Pre-packed medication for a particular patient is loaded into an internet-enabled smart locker, the system then sends an SMS with a one-time-pin (OTP) to the patients. The patient would then come to a collection unit, authenticate themselves using a one-time-pin (OTP) together with their cellphone number. A cubicle that has their medication would then pop-open. 

The system remotely tracks medication collection and treatment compliance while automating visibility on patient behavior, patient outcome and can be integrated into a patient records management system.The solution is targeted at the public healthcare sector that has the challenge of long waiting times. We are leveraging the power of IoT through internet-enabled smart locker devices in public healthcare to remotely track medication collection and treatment compliance while automating visibility on patient behaviour and patient outcome.

The solution is targeted at the public healthcare sector that has the challenge of long waiting times. We have positioned our products for patients in low-income households who don’t use private care. This issue primarily affects low income and rural citizens who can only access state healthcare. Our target beneficiaries make up part of the 82% of the South African population that rely on state-funded care for treatment. This is typically someone who doesn’t have enough money to afford private medical aid and sometimes can’t even afford to spend 12 days a year away from work just to collect chronic medication.

Our key beneficiary is a patient that wants to access life-saving treatment but is spending 3.5 hours in a queue every month they visit a facility. Worldwide, women constitute more than half of all people living with HIV. The proportion of AIDS diagnoses reported among women has more than tripled since 1958. Pelebox empowers all patients to stay on medication and removes barriers to accessing treatment by shortening the collection time.We have 20 units in 20 communities. Each unit has the capacity to reach 1200 patients per month, we are still on early growth phase and have registered 14,000 patients who now have access to a Pelebox Locker near them. Some of the patients collect two months’ supply of medication at the moment. Our average collection time is averaging 22 seconds across all the sites we operate in.

Smart lockers work in African countries where a national health ministry needs to reach more people but is limited by the number of traditional healthcare facilities, staff shortages and higher patient volumes. They operate an economic point, are manufactured locally, have faster lead times to get a site commissioned, are scalable and modular. Overall smart lockers fit into National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill for universal access to medicine. Within NHI the department is looking for solutions that can bring medication closer to the patient and facilitate collections outside of the traditional healthcare setPelebox smart lockers is a next generation solution aimed to contribute to solving the grand challenges facing our future world of 10 billion people.. 

I am a strong believer around what we as South Africans can build with our hands, our hearts and our minds, not only always waiting for the Silicon Valley technologies to come save us. My dream is to set up over 10,000 Pelebox Smart Lockers in townships, Peri-Urban and Rural setting to service a capacity of 10 million people by saving each person 3 hours per month when accessing chronic medication on a monthly basis. This is my Big Hairy Audacious Goal for my continent. We need to see, touch and feel this 4th Industrial Revolution in our communities instead of it being just a concept for the elite. Our mission is to introduce digital solutions within a healthcare infrastructure context.    

In the short term, we want to move from 20 to 47 and then for 100 sites by the end of 2020 serving 114,100 patients per month with 205,380 patients registered for the service. 2021 would then be dedicated to reaching 200 sites and doubling our impact. 

In Future, the intention would be a focus across Sub-Saharan Africa generally, but also with a special interest in Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Zambia, Tanzania based on the size of the target market, then move out focus to Lesotho, Swaziland, Rwanda and Uganda based on ease of doing business. In all the cases, Technovera would focus on engaging the ministry of health directly at a national level to get buy-in and partner with local entities for rollout.We’ve developed Pelebox, a smart locker system that enables patients to collect their repeat chronic medication in under a minute instead of waiting hours on queues at public clinics. It’s an internet-enabled smart locker leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) to enable unassisted patient collections.
The system remotely tracks medication collection and treatment compliance while automating visibility on patient behaviour, patient outcome and can be integrated into a patient records management system.  Pelebox offers a solution to the increasing problem of patient adherence to chronic medication leading to poor health outcomes and straining the healthcare system.

Smart lockers work in African and French cities where a national health ministry needs to reach more people but is limited by the number of traditional healthcare facilities, staff shortages and higher patient volumes. They operate an economic point, are manufactured locally, have faster lead times to get a site commissioned, are scalable and modular. Overall smart lockers fit into National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill for universal access to medicine. 

Additionally the innovation is modular, meaning we can adjust the system’s capacity to meet the population growth at a fraction of the cost of a new system.The biggest thing that we measure if how quickly a patient can collect their repeat chronic medication. This is the time when the patient arrives at the facility to when they leave the collection facility. The focus is to take a patient from 3.5 hours in a queue to 22 seconds using the technology. We want to do this for 10 million people in Africa

Our technology is 10 times cheaper than fancy robotic arms similar systems solving the same challenge, is manufactured locally, and can be scaled into a local clinic without needed to do any modifications to existing structures. These collection points are closer to the patient instead of needing to travel to major hospitals that are kilometres away.We are 7,7 Billion in the world today, every year we add 830 million people with a projection to grow to 10 billion people by 2025. Our work is using science and technology to contribute to the goal of building smart cities. A city that is a better place to live. Creating sustainable prosperity and quality lives for people with chronic conditions.
  
Underpinning this urban sprawl, we also face huge challenges of inequalities. That is why our solution is focused on dense low-income communities that need access to medicine efficiently. We are thinking about the major challenges of the day and tackling access to medicine using a digital technology that leverage self-service to scale and improve convenience.

Our work contributes to the challenge of the 21st Century, by making our cities livable. Our innovation implemented at scale can make a step change to the issue of efficient access to medicine. It's not about trying to determine if we can sustain 10 billion people. It's about building innovations that answer the “How are we going to do it”’
Our Innovation improves convenience in healthcare which correlates to adherence to chronic therapy. These collection points are positioned at transport nodes, central community hubs and other nontraditional healthcare facilities to bring medicine closer to those who need it the most."

Elle développe des solutions dans le secteur des énergies renouvelables et la gestion durable de la mobilité urbaine (matériels et plateforme logicielle) des personnes et des biens pour des villes intelligentes (smart cities).

En effet, l’évolution rapide de la démographie des villes africaines augmente considérablement la densité et le flux d’usagers dans nos villes. En 2050 l’Afrique comptera environ 2,3 milliards de populations et le Bénin en particulier aura 22 millions d’habitants (le double de sa population actuelle). Ces chiffres montrent l’urgence de prévenir par des solutions innovantes, en solutionnant le manque criard d’infrastructures de signalisations routières ceci notamment dû à l’inexistence d’une politique de transfert de technologies et le manque de système d’observation à distance des carrefours. De plus, au Bénin environ quatre personnes en moyenne sont tuées sur la route chaque jour et le dernier rapport de l’OMS estime que de nos jours, la route tue plus que le sida et la tuberculose.  La situation est si urgente que les nations-unies déclarèrent la décennie 2011-2020 « décennie mondiale d'action pour la sécurité routière ».

Face à cette situation, la compagnie ALIVO TECHNOLOGIE développe et fabrique au Bénin des outils technologiques intelligents et autonomes pour la régulation de la circulation routière. C’est la première dans l’espace ouest africain à proposer des caractéristiques qui répondent aux exigences de la ville intelligente et des objectifs du développement durable.

Les résultats concrets des travaux de recherches de la compagnie sont entre autres, la conception, la fabrication, l’assemblage et le déploiement de son nouveau dispositif de régulation de la circulation au carrefour du 10ème arrondissement de la ville de Cotonou. Ce dispositif est mis en service depuis le 1er Janvier 2019 et est le produit d’une collaboration fructueuse avec les acteurs tels que le Centre National de la Sécurité Routière (CNSR), l’Agence Nationale des Transports Terrestres (ANATT), la Direction Générale des Infrastructures (DGI), l’Agence Béninoise de Valorisation des Résultats de la Recherche et de l’Innovation Technologique (ABEVRIT) et la Mairie de Cotonou.
La compagnie ALIVO TECHNOLOGIE commercialise aujourd’hui :
* des lanternes tricolores et bicolores de dimensions variables (100 - 200 – 300 mm),
* des matrices afficheur numériques et alphabétiques,
* des ordinateurs de bord embarqués,
* des applications de gestion de la mobilité urbaine,
* Automatisation de processus
* des formations

ALIVO TECHNOLOGIE envisage se positionner comme la toute première industrie-référence pour fournir des solutions durables et intelligentes en Afrique.La solution ALIVO développée et fabriquée par ALIVO TECHNOLOGIE se définit comme un système technologique intelligent et autonome de régulation de la circulation routière. C’est la première à intégrer des caractéristiques qui répondent au nouveau cahier de charge de la ville du futur.

Elle est dotée d’une électronique embarquée capable d’évaluer en fonction des heures de la journée, le taux de congestion sur chaque branche d’un carrefour en adaptant en conséquence la régulation des usagers afin d’optimiser la gestion du carrefour. Elle est équipée d’une caméra de surveillance pour la télé-observation du carrefour depuis un centre de contrôle distant. Elle compte une bande défilante de divers messages de sensibilisations aux bonnes pratiques sur la sécurité routière dans nos villes. Elle peut prendre en compte l’accessibilité et la priorité des usagers-piétons non-voyants car elle pourra disposer de système sonore d’avertissement correspondant à l’état des foyers lumineux.

Son impact social est appréciable sur plusieurs plans, elle offre : un fort potentiel de création d’emplois directs et indirects, une faible empreinte environnementale grâce à l’option solaire choisie pour l’alimentation des dispositifs, une sécurité aux usagers du carrefour installé car limite considérablement les d'accidents et les achoppements tout en optimisant le temps de déplacement.Le projet ALIVO cible les domaines ferroviaire, maritime et terrestre où l’utilisation de systèmes de signalisation pour la régulation d’un trafic est requise. De façon spécifique pour ce qui concerne les infrastructures routières les cibles sont les administrations communales, le pouvoir central, les entreprises du BTP, les partenaires techniques et financiers, les ONGs intervenant dans le domaine de la sécurité routière. En chiffre, seul 20% des carrefours de Cotonou dispose de systèmes de feux tricolores fiables, soit 80% de marchés encore disponible.
Nous procéderons donc par :
-	l’exécution de contrat de marchés-publics pour l’installation de feux tricolores intelligents et économiques.
-	l’exécution de contrat de garantie locative de systèmes de feux de signalisation routière.
-	la vente des technologies développées par notre Startup.
-	la vente de la licence d’exploitation de la technologie.
-	la location de matériels de signalisations.
-	la fourniture de services et équipements de télésurveillance des carrefours.
-   la mise en place d’un partenariat public-privé : plus de marchés pour plus d’emplois crées.
Aussi nous devons assurer :
-   une politique de contrat de maintenance des carrefours (source de revenus pérenne).
-   une politique de diversification de nos produits et services (revenus multiples)
-	un S.A.V disponible.
-	un coût très compétitif.
-   une meilleure qualité de service et des produits performants.Nous avons installé au carrefour du 10ème arrondissement de la ville de Cotonou, un modèle de nos dispositifs de régulation depuis le 1er janvier 2019. Et partir de cet acquis, nous avons incessamment des travaux de mise en œuvre de notre technologie dans plusieurs villes du Bénin comme Ouidah, Bohicon et Parakou. Des discussions fructueuses sont aussi engagées avec plusieurs villes dans la sous-région à savoir : Pointe-Noire, Nouakchott, Ouagadougou, Niamey, la Côte-d’Ivoire mais aussi des contacts déjà établis avec l’Algérie.La solution ALIVO intégrera progressivement au cours des deux prochaines années, une expansion de Technologie Cloud à l’échelle d’une ville intelligente où tous les carrefours de la ville interagiront entre elles pour créer un réseau d’optimisation des déplacements des personnes et des biens sur la base des ressources technologiques en IA (Intelligence Artificielle). Mieux la plateforme de gestion pourra opérer des choix stratégiques sur la base d’un ensemble de capteurs d’appréciations de taux de congestion sur des axes et/ou en fonction des données d’état de trafic fournies par l’API Google Map et ses satellites.

Nous ambitionnons aussi d’ici cinq années, devenir une industrie-référence et leader pour la production de systèmes intelligents de feux de signalisations solaires et couvrir les carrefours du Bénin. Aussi étendre nos services et produits en Afrique de l’ouest et progressivement à toute l’Afrique.
ALIVO TECHNOLOGIE a eu la chance depuis le lancement du carrefour pilote à Cotonou, de prendre contact avec plusieurs structures PMEs du secteur des énergies renouvelables dans quelques pays en Afrique comme la Côte-d’Ivoire, le Congo, le Burkina-Faso, la Mauritanie… Ces structures nous servent favorablement de passerelles du fait de leurs relations commerciales déjà établies avec les municipalités locales depuis plusieurs années.

Nos prévisions en termes de chiffre d’affaire frôlent les 200.000.000 de FCFA en 2 ans et 700.000.000 de FCFA d’ici 5 ans.
Nous pensons que la cité des solutions sera une instance forte et une source d'impulsion pour notre initiative entrepreneuriale. Participer la cité des solutions sera aussi une opportunité de vivre un écosystème qui rassemble les acteurs du monde entrepreneurial africain et français pour former, impulser, développer et entretenir un réseau avec des innovateurs, des experts et des investisseurs dans la progression de notre projet de ville intelligente.La préservation de la sécurité et la libre circulation des personnes et des biens nécessite l’installation correcte du système de signalisation et de régulation dans nos différentes villes.

* et enfin, la possibilité de mettre en place du processus de fabrication dans un espace de travail de taille réduite.« Emploi et richesse sociale » : La solution ALIVO apporte un impact social appréciable sur plusieurs plans, elle offre un fort potentiel de création d’emplois directs et indirects. Au Bénin l’équipe du projet se donne vocation de former et d’employer environ 10 techniciens communaux à la maîtrise des technologies de la gestion de la mobilité. C’est dire donc qu’au moins 700 techniciens locaux (pour 77 communes béninoises) feront partir d’ALIVO TECHNOLOGIE sans oublier son personnel du département de la Recherche & Développement, de sa ligne de production et de son appareil commercial. Le personnel féminin comptera pour au moins 40% de l’effectif total du personnel opérationnel et affichera un brassage de compétences, d’idées et de culture Afrique-France pour le meilleur de la ville du futur.
« Ecologie » : De plus elle a une faible empreinte environnementale grâce à l’option solaire choisie pour l’alimentation du système, elle mise donc sur des sources d’énergies propres et éco-responsables.
« Démographie et santé publique » : Enfin, elle promet une sécurité aux usagers des axes de la ville car elle limite considérablement les d'accidents de la circulation et les achoppements entre usagers tout en optimisant le temps de déplacement."

10,134,mobilite,"Notre start-up se nomme ""Hana"", c’est une application mobile de VTC- Transport voiture avec chauffeur. Les particularités de notre business model sont :

·         Un service dédié uniquement aux femmes et réalisé par les femmes.

·         Les voitures utilisé ce sont des voitures hybrides ou 100% électrique.

 

L'application Hana est destinée à toutes les femmes qui possèdent des smartphones Android et iOs.
L'application permet aux clientes user, de réserver des conductrices muni de voiture Electric ou hybride, à l'aide d'un smartphone par un système de géolocalisation.
Le projet sera lancé dans un premier temps en Algérie et par la suite au Maghreb.

Par ce projet, nous souhaitons apporter une solution à l'insertion des femmes sur le marché du travail et nous souhaitons contribuer à favoriser une ville verte et durable qui respecte l’environnement et le bien-être de l’humain.La solution réside dans la mise en relation des femmes chauffeurs et les clientes user via une application sur smart phone par un système de géolocalisation. Cette solution permet de faciliter les déplacements et elle permet de créer par la même occasion de l'emploi.

 

Cette solution sera exposée également aux entreprises.Notre start-up se positionne sur le marché de la prestation de services ; organisation de services de transport de passager pour des tiers par le biais d'une application en ligne. 

Notre application met en contact deux parties, les clientes user avec les conductrices, de ce fait notre public cible serait d'une part les clientes user (femmes actives, étudiantes, femmes au foyer...)  et d'autre part des femmes conductrices.
La zone géographique choisie pour le lancement de l'application est l'Algérie et plus précisément la capitale Alger.AlgérieActuellement, notre équipe travaille sur d'autres services pour développer cette activité, et assurer la durabilité et la rentabilité de Hana.


Néanmoins, le premier axe sur lequel nous nous concentrons en priorité est le recrutement des conductrices  Nous avons réfléchi et mis en place plusieurs actions pour atteindre cet objectif.


En outre, nous travaillerons également sur d’autres orientations stratégiques pour le développement de l'activité de notre entreprise, à savoir :
• Développer d'autres services.
• Conquérir de nouveaux marchés (Nouvelle ville en Algérie)
• Développer un programme de fidélité

Et à long terme nous souhaitons exporter Hana vers d'autres pays du grand Maghreb et des pays Africain.L'innovation Hana est basée sur un algorithme qui relie les travailleurs (femmes conductrices) indépendantes à des consommatrices (user).

• L'innovation Hana qui sera adoptée par le public féminin, générera
des gains de productivité. L'offre innovante crée de la richesse et renouvelle le stock d'emplois.

 

Les véhicules utilisés comme moyen de déplacement seront des véhicules électriques ou hybrides.

• Notre offre va changer la chaîne de valeur ; les habitudes de consommation.

• La nouvelle offre impacte le budget des ménages : le client historique gagne en pouvoir d’achats et peut en outre consommer.L'application existe (la technologie, le design, le code source...) à partir de là il est possible de dupliquer et d'exporter notre solution partout ailleurs à moindre coût.

 

Nous aurons même la possibilité de louer notre solution à des acteurs locaux ayant l’ambition de se lancer sur ce créneau.Notre start-Up a pour ambition de répondre à plusieurs défis du développement durable et pour chaque défi Hana apporte une innovation :
L’objectif numéro 5: ÉGALITÉ ENTRE LES SEXES
L’égalité des sexes n’est pas seulement un droit fondamental de la personne, mais aussi un fondement nécessaire pour l’instauration d’un monde pacifique, prospère et durable.
Dans nos sociétés Africaines et même Européenne, le service des VTC est principalement un service contrôlé et monopoliser par la gente masculine, avec notre Start Up Hana nous souhaitons innover et mettre en exergue la place de la femme dans le monde des VTC et du digital. 
L’objectif numéro 7: ÉNERGIE PROPRE ET D'UN COÛT ABORDABLE
L’énergie durable est une opportunité pour transformer les vies, les économies et la planète.
Les véhicules que la start-up Hana envisage d’utiliser sont des voitures hybrides qui rechargent leur batterie dans des stations dédiées qui utilisent des panneaux solaires.
L’objectif numéro 8 : TRAVAIL DÉCENT ET CROISSANCE ÉCONOMIQUE
De par notre idée de start-up nous souhaitons produire un impact sur les  politiques économiques et sociales visant à éliminer la pauvreté et les inégalités entres les sexes.
La start-up Hana offre un travail décent, sûr et flexible pour les femmes qui souhaitent devenir autonome financièrement.
Hana est également un moyen d'obtenir des revenus supplémentaires (Offre une bonne scolarité pour les enfants, inscrire les enfants dans des loisirs, sport, améliorer la vie quotidien"
